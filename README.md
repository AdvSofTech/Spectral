# Spectral

Formalization project of the CMU HoTT group towards formalizing the Serre spectral sequence.

## Things to do for Lean SS project

Lang's algebra (revised 3rd edition) contains a chapter on general homology theory, with a section on spectral sequences. Thus, we can use this book at least as an outline for the algebraic part of the project.

###To Do:
- R-modules, vector spaces,
- some basic theory: product, tensor, hom, projective,
- categories of algebras, abelian categories,

###Already Done:
- definition of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, 
- some algebra: quotient, product, free.
